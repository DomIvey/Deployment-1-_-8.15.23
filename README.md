DEPLOYMENT 1

WHAT WENT WRONG:
Creating the folders in the repository
I clicked around until I figured it out. I had to open the folders individually and add the contents to my repository

Jenkins
Rewatched the video to remember how to create my credentials

Tyrone helped me with the issue below. I was trying to figure out a lot at once and forgot to document what the issue actually was here and how to fix it. I believe it had something to do with my credentials. Once this was fixed I was able to run Jenkins successfully

I had issues with EB at first because my zipped files werenâ€™t saved properly. Nicole and Kevin helped me to resave my zipped files and reupload. From there, I followed the Scribe directions and was able to run EB successfully: Url-shortener-env.eba-9pmrmvp8.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
